                Hi! I’m a 21-year-old second-year Information Technology student in St. Dominic College of Asia. 
                I’m currently exploring how technology can be used to improve everyday life and create smarter solutions. 
                As an IT student, I enjoy learning about how systems work and how to build and code applications and websites. 
                Whether it’s coding, creating a database, or working on collaborative tech projects, I thrive on the challenge of turning ideas into functional and user-friendly solutions. 
                I’m also growing my skills in areas like web development, networking, and java coding. Outside the classroom, I’m someone who values continuous learning, teamwork, and creativity. 
                I believe technology is not just about machines it’s about people, and how we can connect and grow through innovation. 
                This portfolio is a reflection of my journey so far, and I’m excited to keep learning, improving, and building along the way.
